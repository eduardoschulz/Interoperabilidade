# Near RealTime RIC

## Installation

### Containerd and kubernetes (skip if already installed)

First things first install containerd, kubeadm and kubectl. The cluster configuration passed to kubeadm is available (here)[RICs/near-realtime/oran-sc/config.yaml] and the only required modification is under the "CertSANs" option you should change to the hostname of your machine. This modification ensures that the self-signed certificates generated by kubeadm will remain valid for your machine after a change in IP address, which is common for us, as long as you as acessing it using its hostname.


<--! xApps built with docker need to be imported into containerd under the k8s.io namespace -->
